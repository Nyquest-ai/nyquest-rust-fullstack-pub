# Nyquest Role-Based Compression Testing

**Version:** 3.1.1 (Rust Full-Stack)  
**Date:** February 28, 2026  
**Author:** Nyquest AI  
**Engine:** Nyquest Compression Engine (Rust)  
**Platform:** Ubuntu 24.04

---

## 1. Overview

Role-Based Testing (RBT) validates the Nyquest compression engine across 25 distinct AI persona scenarios spanning 7 real-world categories. Each scenario consists of a verbose system prompt loaded with common LLM boilerplate patterns and a realistic user query. The test measures token reduction, semantic preservation, and throughput at multiple compression levels.

### Objectives

- Quantify compression savings across diverse professional domains
- Verify that domain-specific terminology is preserved (not compressed)
- Confirm compression scales monotonically with compression level
- Establish per-category baselines for production deployment targets
- Validate that no semantic meaning is lost during compression

## 4. Category Analysis

### Compression Ranking by Category

| Rank | Category | Avg Savings | Avg Latency | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Academic | 15.9% | 1,239 µs | Highest filler density |
| 2 | Corporate | 15.7% | 1,340 µs | Heavy boilerplate patterns |
| 3 | Medical | 14.4% | 1,440 µs | More domain terms preserved |
| 4 | Small Business | 13.5% | 1,524 µs | Moderate filler + colloquial |
| 5 | Home | 12.5% | 1,496 µs | Mixed filler + practical |
| 6 | Robot/Vehicle | 12.6% | 1,597 µs | Safety-critical preserves more |
| 7 | Scientific | 11.8% | 1,391 µs | Highest domain term density |

### Key Findings

1. **System prompts absorb 90%+ of savings** — user messages are typically concise and domain-specific, leaving little to compress.

2. **Domain terminology is 100% preserved** — all tested terms (HIPAA, FHIR, STEMI, IPCC, PFAS, Sarbanes-Oxley, EEOC, CRAAP, NSF, SKU, Matter) survive compression intact.

3. **Scientific roles compress least** because their prompts contain the highest density of technical jargon that the engine correctly identifies as semantically critical.

4. **Academic and Corporate roles compress most** because they are loaded with business/academic filler patterns: "It is important to note that...", "Please note that...", "Due to the fact that...", "For the purpose of facilitating...", "In order to utilize...".

5. **Robot/Vehicle roles show moderate compression** — safety-critical language is preserved (e.g., "driver safety is the absolute top priority") while boilerplate is removed.

6. **All roles pass monotonic test** — higher compression levels always produce fewer or equal tokens, never more.

## 5. Formal Test Suite

**Location:** `tests/role_based_test.rs`  
**Run:** `cargo test --test role_based_test`

### Test Cases

| Test | Description | Assertion |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `test_all_roles_compress_above_minimum` | Every role meets its minimum savings threshold | Academic/Corporate ≥ 10%, Medical/Scientific ≥ 8% |
| `test_no_role_loses_tokens` | Compression never increases token count | `optimized ≤ original` for all 25 roles |
| `test_level_zero_is_passthrough` | Level 0.0 produces identical output | `original == compressed` for all 25 roles |
| `test_domain_terms_preserved` | Critical domain terms survive compression | 11 terms across all categories verified |
| `test_compression_monotonic_with_level` | Higher levels = more compression | Tokens decrease monotonically: 0.0 → 0.2 → 0.5 → 0.8 → 1.0 |
| `test_aggregate_savings_above_target` | Overall savings meets product target | Aggregate ≥ 10% across all 25 roles |

## 6. Compression Pattern Examples

Patterns targeted by the Nyquest engine across all role prompts:

| Input Pattern | Compressed Output | Category |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| "Please note that it is important to note that" | *(removed)* | Filler |
| "It is important to note that" | *(removed)* | Filler |
| "Due to the fact that" | "because" | Verbose |
| "For the purpose of facilitating" | "to facilitate" | Verbose |
| "In order to utilize" | "to use" | Verbose |
| "You should make sure to" | *(removed)* | Filler |
| "Please ensure that you always" | *(removed or shortened)* | Filler |
| "Needless to say, as you know" | *(removed)* | Filler |
| "Basically, the goal is to" | *(removed)* | Filler |
| "Act as a senior developer who is an expert in Python" | "Expert: Python" | Role |
| "January 14th, 2025" | "25-01-14" | Date |
| "forty-two thousand dollars" | "42k dollars" | Number |

## 8. Performance Optimization Log

### Critical Bug: compress_dates() Regex Recompilation

**Discovered:** Feb 28, 2026  
**Impact:** 118x performance degradation at compression level >= 0.5  
**Root cause:** `compress_dates()` compiled 24 new Regex objects per invocation  
**Fix:** Moved all date patterns to `Lazy<Vec<...>>` static, compiled once at startup  
**Result:** 9,250 µs → 4.1 µs (2,256x improvement)

### Before/After

| Scenario | Before | After | Speedup |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Small text @ 0.5 | 9,304 µs | 108 µs | 86x |
| Medium request @ 0.5 | 37,693 µs | 783 µs | 48x |
| Large 20-turn @ 0.5 | 103,403 µs | 1,550 µs | 67x |

## 9. Memory Profile

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| VmPeak | 25.7 MB |
| VmRSS | 24.3 MB |

Memory is stable across all 25 roles with no growth observed during repeated benchmark runs.
